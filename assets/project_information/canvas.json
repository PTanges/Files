    "project_name":"canvas",
    "description":"<b>Description:</b><br>Developed and deployed a web application with Flask which allows users to simultaneously collaborate on a canvas with real-time connectivity.<br><br>The project features cross-platform compatibility with mobile and desktop devices. The interface was designed with modern responsive UI to maximize user experience. Websockets connect users with a persistent connection for near-instant delivery times.",
    "challenges":"<b>Challenges:</b><br>The project ran into many developmental roadblocks due to the unfamiliarity with the frameworks chosen. Research pointed to Django for the dynamic HTML support which seemed to be a necessity at the time. However the choice seemed to fall short in many areas, ultimately resulting in having to scrap the existing progress, and having to swap over to a more friendly framework in Flask. As a result of the lost development time, many features needed to be trimmed from the final product for the initial release.",
    "outcome":"<b>Outcome:</b><br>The project has been deployed and can be connected with via many devices. The entire experience has given me the confidence to approach and learn software tools independently of my courses. While the final product has shifted course from the initial idea, I am ultimately satisfied with the functionality of the canvas.",
