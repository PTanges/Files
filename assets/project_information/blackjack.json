    "description":"<b>Description:</b><br>A Python command line interface program which allows a player to play Blackjack against an AI (utilizing the Monte Carlo algorithm) and the dealer.",
    "challenges":"<b>Challenges:</b><br>Challenges arrived in the form of code structure. In order for the game to swap between the player and other agents, each agent would need to be self-sufficient in managing their own states. A shared parent class handling various shared functions allowed for the game-handler to rotate between agents, regardless of player type.",
    "outcome":"<b>Outcome:</b><br>The decision to use the Monte Carlo algorithm for the AI agent proved to be successful. While the Monte Carlo agent does not boast a positive winrate against either the player agent nor the house agent, the effective result highlights a flaw in the algorithm itself. The randomness of the simulations may cause the agent to choose poorly simply due to luck, such as calling for 'Hit' at nineteen points out of twenty-one points.",
