# Portfolio
A single-page website to display projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The portfolio site acts a functional resume with an intuitive user flow for reading about the various projects being showcased. Reactive design components, such as adjusting components with window resizing, were built with the user in mind. Additionally, features such as a theme / mode swap button and the quick load time due to the site being single-page assist in the user experience.
